	* rtcl.test: Make two tests expect exact errors so as to better
	detect changes upstream.

	* rtcl.c: Fix bug that would cause REval to only process the first
	of n expressions passed to it. Also cleaned up error messages
	returned from R so these can be more easily parsed in Tcl.

	* Makefile.in, configure.ac: Bring back R_ placeholders and custom
	script to find R because the environment could not be found with
	the merged changes (not sure why, didn't bother to investigate
	further). Didn't make use of R's compat includes as these would be
	out-of-date with R's actual includes and it would be better to use
	latter verbatim (left compat/R as an example of what could be
	done).

	* Merged changes from Christian with adjustments as noted
	above. Removed numerous sample files from TEA. Rtcl moves to
	version 1.2.

	Reworked everything to use runtime linking libR.so et.al.

2018-05-13  Matt Adams  <matt.adams@stuffbymatt.ca>

	* rtcl.c: New Rtcl 1.1 version adds optional -verbose switch to
	all Rtcl commands. Presence of -verbose causes embedded R
	interpreter to print the results of R expressions to stdout as
	they are evaluated. This may be used to debug the results of R
	expressions as Rtcl commands are run. This was the default in 1.0
	however it causes huge log files. Change based on patch and
	suggestion provided by Luc Moulinier <luc.moulinier@unistra.fr>.

	* doc/Rtcl.n: Updated nroff man page for -verbose switch

	* doc/Rtcl.tmml: Updated doctools man page for -verbose switch

2018-04-13  Matt Adams  <matt.adams@radicaldynamic.com>

	* rtcl.c: New Rtcl 1.0 version compatible with Tcl 8.6.8 and R
	3.4.4 based on previous work by Neil McKay. Introduces ::rtcl
	namespace, new "source" command, renames "getval" command to
	"getvalue", renames "type" command to "gettype". Embeds R as per
	current R manual "Writing R Extensions" and handles error in same
	Tcl interpreter vs. static interp used in previous
	versions. Includes Tcl unit tests.

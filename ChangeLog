	* rtcl.c: New Rtcl 1.0 version compatible with Tcl 8.6.8 and R
	3.4.4 based on previous work by Neil McKay. Introduces ::rtcl
	namespace, new "source" command, renames "getval" command to
	"getvalue", renames "type" command to "gettype". Embeds R as per
	current R manual "Writing R Extensions" and handles error in same
	Tcl interpreter vs. static interp used in previous
	versions. Includes Tcl unit tests.

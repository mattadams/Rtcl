	* rtcl.c: New Rtcl 1.1 version adds optional -verbose switch to
	all Rtcl commands. Presence of -verbose causes embedded R
	interpreter to print the results of R expressions to stdout as
	they are evaluated. This may be used to debug the results of R
	expressions as Rtcl commands are run. This was the default in 1.0
	however it causes huge log files. Change based on patch and
	suggestion provided by Luc Moulinier <luc.moulinier@unistra.fr>.

	* doc/Rtcl.n: Updated nroff man page for -verbose switch

	* doc/Rtcl.tmml: Updated doctools man page for -verbose switch

	* rtcl.c: New Rtcl 1.0 version compatible with Tcl 8.6.8 and R
	3.4.4 based on previous work by Neil McKay. Introduces ::rtcl
	namespace, new "source" command, renames "getval" command to
	"getvalue", renames "type" command to "gettype". Embeds R as per
	current R manual "Writing R Extensions" and handles error in same
	Tcl interpreter vs. static interp used in previous
	versions. Includes Tcl unit tests.

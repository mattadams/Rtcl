	Rtcl - A Tcl Extension for Embedding the R Statistical Language
	---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
===========

The Rtcl extension embeds an interpreter for the R programming language
(see http://www.r-project.org) inside a Tcl interpreter. It provides
commands for evaluating R expressions, for importing their values
into Tcl, and for determining their type.

REQUIREMENTS
============

Rtcl requires several software packages to be installed:

	1. Tcl, version 8.x or higher
	2. R, built with shared libraries
	3. The R sources. (Unfortunately, some of the functions in
	   R that are required to evaluate R expressions are private,
	   so the source includes are needed.)

INSTALLATION
============

Installation of Rtcl follows Tcl's usual configure/make/make install
pattern. A typical installation on Unix will look like:

	% tar xvzf Rtcl0.1.tar.gz
	% cd Rtcl0.1
	% ./configure
	% make
	% su
	password:
	# make install
	# ^D
	%

The configure script accepts a number of options, including:

	--with-tcl=tclDir	Take Tcl config info from "tclDir"
	--with-R-src=RSrcDir	Find the R sources in RSrcDir

Specifying the "--with-R-src" option will considerably speed up
the configuration process; if it isn't specified, the configure script
does a "find" command to find the R source directory, searching through
your entire home directory (and a few other places).

NOTES
=====

The current version of Rtcl is 0.1. It is very definitely alpha-quality
code. So far, it has only been run on Redhat Linux 8.0.
